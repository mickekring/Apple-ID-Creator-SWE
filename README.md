Apple-ID-Creator-Sweden
==========================

This is a fork of garrya100's great script adapted and changed for use with the Swedish version of iTunes.<br />
Please show your appreciation of the amount of work that has gone into this by making a donation to a charity of your choice.

You use this script at your own risk. There are no warranties, direct or implied.

<strong>TRIED AND TESTED SRETUP</strong><br />
OSX version: Yosemite 10.10.2<br />
iTunes version: 12.1.0.50

<strong>So far this is just a work in progress and should not be used just yet.</strong>

<strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Apple uses a velocity check to prevent too many Apple IDs from a single IP address. You must contact your Apple business representative to request that your IP address is whitelisted for a short time.</li>
<li>Being AppleScript, this runs only on Macs.</li>
<li>iTunes 10.7 is currently required. Future versions may break the script.</li>
<li>UI Scripting allows us to script otherwise non-scriptbale interfaces. Turn this on in System Preferences > Accessibility and check "Enable access for assistive devices."</li>
<li>Apple has strong password requirements. Account creation will fail if the passwords are too weak.</li>
</ul>

<strong>HOW TO</strong>
<ul>
<li>Download the zip file and extract to a location of your choice.</li>
<li>Edit the UserID-template.xlsx file in Excel and add your desired account information. Leave the empty columns empty.</br>
Save/export the file as a .csv file (comma separated). On OSX with swedish regional settings this will generate a semi colon separated text file.</li>
<li>Run the AppleScript and point to your .csv file when asked for. If the file is correct, sit back and enjoy.</li>
</ul>
